## OBJECTIVE: ##
The objective of this project is to implement an Autonomous Hovercraft that will race on a specified course in less than 2 minutes with less collision possible.


## DESCRIPTION: ##
Design, analyze, simulate, build, and test a prototype of a hovercraft. This prototype will enter a competition in which the group will have to successfully fly the
hovercraft through a maze. The hovercraft should move through the maze, making 90-degree turns, detecting an opening in a wall,etc.

The final score in the competition is ùëÜ = ùëòùê∑/(ùëá ‚àô ùëÉ), where ùëÜ is the score, ùëá is the time
(in seconds), ùëÉ > 0 is the number of components used in the design, ùê∑ is the distance along the track that was successfully and ùëò is the scaling factor equal for all teams.
### MAZE DIMENSIONS: ###
The maze will have three obstacles of increasing height along the course
